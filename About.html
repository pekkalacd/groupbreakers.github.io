	<p style = "color: grey;"><b>groupbreakers.github.io is intended as a free randomization tool for and dedicated to the hobbyists and professionals that make up the sports card community on YouTube. <br><br> Some key features that set it apart from other randomization sites are: </b></p>

	<ul style = "color: grey;"><b>
		<li>You can optionally auto-populate teams/divisions per sport for random style breaks; <br>
		or you can manually enter them</li>
		<br>
		<li>Both the team/division/player (etc) randomization and the customer randomization happen simultaneously <br> on the same page. So you don't need multiple tabs open.</li>
		<br>
		<li>The randomizer is easy to reset and made for frequent re-use</li>
		<br>
		<li>Results from the randoms have the option to be automatically exported to an Excel file</li>
